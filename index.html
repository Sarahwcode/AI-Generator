          The Trick to Holding On
          <p>
            Let go of the ones who hurt you Let go of the ones you outgrow Let
            go of the words they hurl your way as you’re walking out the door
            The only thing cut and dry In this hedge-maze life Is the fact that
            their words will cut but your tears will dry
          </p>
          <p>
            They don’t tell you this when you are young You can’t hold on to
            everything Can’t show up for everyone You pick your poison Or your
            cure Phone numbers you know by heart And the ones you don’t answer
            any more
          </p>
          Hold on to the faint recognition in the eye of a stranger As it
          catches you in its lustrous net How quickly we become intertwined How
          wonderful it is to forget All the times your intuition failed you But
          it hasn’t killed you yet Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
          swims and your blazing self-respect
          <p>
            And if you drive the roads of this town Ones you’ve gone down so
            many times before Flashback to all the times Life nearly ran you off
            the road But tonight your hand is steady Suddenly you’ll know The
            trick to holding on Was all that letting go
          </p>
