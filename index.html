        The Trick to Holding On
        <p>
          Let go of the ones who hurt you Let go of the ones you outgrow Let go
          of the words they hurl your way as you’re walking out the door The
          only thing cut and dry In this hedge-maze life Is the fact that their
          words will cut but your tears will dry
        </p>
        <p>
          They don’t tell you this when you are young You can’t hold on to
          everything Can’t show up for everyone You pick your poison Or your
          cure Phone numbers you know by heart And the ones you don’t answer any
          more
        </p>
        Hold on to the faint recognition in the eye of a stranger As it catches
        you in its lustrous net How quickly we become intertwined How wonderful
        it is to forget All the times your intuition failed you But it hasn’t
        killed you yet Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight swims and your
        blazing self-respect
        <p>
          And if you drive the roads of this town Ones you’ve gone down so many
          times before Flashback to all the times Life nearly ran you off the
          road But tonight your hand is steady Suddenly you’ll know The trick to
          holding on Was all that letting go
        </p>
